The **Nervaâ€“Antonine dynasty** was a [dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty "Dynasty") of seven [Roman Emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Emperor "Roman Emperor") who ruled over the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") from 96 AD to 192 AD. These Emperors are [Nerva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerva "Nerva"), [Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan "Trajan"), [Hadrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian "Hadrian"), [Antoninus Pius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoninus_Pius "Antoninus Pius"), [Lucius Verus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Verus "Lucius Verus"), [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius "Marcus Aurelius"), and [Commodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus "Commodus").

The first five of the six successions within this dynasty were notable in that the reigning Emperor [adopted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_adoption "Roman adoption") the candidate of his choice to be his successor. Under Roman law, an adoption established a bond legally as strong as that of kinship.  Because of this, all but the first and last of the Nerva-Antonine emperors are called **Adoptive Emperors**.
