The **Severan dynasty** was a [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome") imperial [dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty "Dynasty"), which ruled the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") between 193 and 235. The dynasty was founded by the general [Septimius Severus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus "Septimius Severus"), who rose to power as the victor of the [193â€“197 civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Five_Emperors "Year of the Five Emperors").

Although Septimius Severus successfully restored peace following the upheaval of the late 2nd century, the dynasty was disturbed by highly unstable family relationships, as well as constant political turmoil foreshadowing the imminent [Crisis of the Third Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century "Crisis of the Third Century"). 
It was one of the  last lineages of the [Principate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principate "Principate") founded by [Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus "Augustus").
