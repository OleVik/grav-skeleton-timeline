The **Gordian dynasty**, sometimes known as the **Gordianic dynasty**, was short-lived, ruling the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") from 238â€“244 AD. The dynasty achieved the throne in 238 AD, after [Gordian I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_I "Gordian I") and his son [Gordian II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_II "Gordian II") rose up against Emperor [Maximinus Thrax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximinus_Thrax "Maximinus Thrax") and were proclaimed co-emperors by the [Roman Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate "Roman Senate"). Gordian II was killed by the governor of [Numidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numidia "Numidia"), [Capillianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Capillianus&action=edit&redlink=1 "Capillianus (page does not exist)") and Gordian I killed himself shortly after, either 21 or 36 days after he was declared emperor. On 22 April 238, [Pupienus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupienus "Pupienus") and [Balbinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balbinus "Balbinus"), who were not of the Gordian dynasty, were declared co-emperors but the Senate was forced to make [Gordian III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_III "Gordian III") a third co-emperor on 27 May 238, due to the demands of the Roman people. Maximinus attempted to invade Italy but he was killed by his own soldiers when his army became frustrated. After this, the [Praetorian Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praetorian_Guard "Praetorian Guard") killed Pupienus and Balbinus, leaving Gordian III as the sole emperor. Gordian III ruled until 244 AD when he was either killed after his betrayal by [Philip the Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_the_Arab "Philip the Arab"), killed by Philip the Arab or killed at the [Battle of Misiche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Misiche "Battle of Misiche"); with his death, the dynasty was ended and Philip the Arab became emperor.
