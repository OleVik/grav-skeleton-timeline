The **Theodosian dynasty** was a Roman family that rose to eminence in the waning days of the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"). Its founding father was Flavius Theodosius (often referred to as [Count Theodosius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Theodosius "Count Theodosius")), a great general who had saved [Britannia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Britain "Roman Britain") from the [Great Conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Conspiracy "Great Conspiracy"). His son, [Flavius Theodosius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I "Theodosius I") was made emperor of the [Eastern Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire "Eastern Roman Empire") in 379, and briefly reunited the Roman Empire 394â€“395 by defeating the usurper [Eugenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenius "Eugenius").
