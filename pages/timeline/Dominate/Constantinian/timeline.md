The **Constantinian dynasty** is an informal name for the ruling family of the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") from [Constantius Chlorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantius_Chlorus "Constantius Chlorus") (died 305) to the death of [Julian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_(emperor) "Julian (emperor)") in 363. It is named after its most famous member, [Constantine the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great "Constantine the Great") who became the sole ruler of the empire in 324. The dynasty is also called **Neo-Flavian** because every Constantinian emperor bore the name Flavius, similarly to the rulers of the first [Flavian dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavian_dynasty "Flavian dynasty") in the 1st century.
